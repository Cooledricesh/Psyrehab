## Overview

The PsyRehab application handles sensitive patient data and requires robust security measures. Regular security audits ensure that our security posture remains strong and compliant with industry standards.

### Objectives
- Identify and assess security vulnerabilities
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
- Maintain security best practices
- Protect patient confidentiality and data integrity
- Prevent unauthorized access and data breaches

## Automated Security Tools

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
```bash
# ESLint Security Plugin
npm install eslint-plugin-security --save-dev

# Semgrep for code security scanning
npm install @semgrep/semgrep-core --save-dev
```

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
```bash
# OWASP ZAP for web application scanning
# Configure ZAP baseline scan
zap-baseline.py -t https://your-app-url.com
```

### Dependency Scanning
```bash
# npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Snyk for advanced vulnerability scanning
npm install -g snyk
snyk test
```

### Infrastructure Scanning
```bash
# Docker container scanning
docker scan your-image:tag

# Terraform security scanning
tfsec .
```

## Manual Security Testing

### 1. Authentication Testing
- Test login mechanisms
- Verify session timeout
- Check password complexity requirements
- Test account lockout functionality
- Verify multi-factor authentication

### 2. Authorization Testing
- Test role-based access controls
- Verify horizontal privilege escalation protection
- Test vertical privilege escalation protection
- Check direct object reference protection

### 3. Input Validation Testing
- Test SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Check XSS protection
- Verify file upload restrictions
- Test command injection protection
- Check XXE vulnerabilities

### 4. Session Management Testing
- Test session fixation protection
- Verify session invalidation
- Check session timeout mechanisms
- Test concurrent session handling

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Risk Classification

| Risk Level | Score | Action Required |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Critical | 9.0-10.0 | Immediate fix required (24 hours) |
| High | 7.0-8.9 | Fix within 7 days |
| Medium | 4.0-6.9 | Fix within 30 days |
| Low | 0.1-3.9 | Fix within 90 days |

### Vulnerability Tracking

Create issues for each vulnerability with:
- Unique identifier
- Risk level
- Description
- Affected components
- Remediation steps
- Assigned developer
- Target fix date
- Verification requirements

## Incident Response

3. **Eradication**
   - Remove threats
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Update security measures

4. **Recovery**
   - Restore systems
   - Monitor for persistence
   - Validate functionality

5. **Lessons Learned**
   - Document incident
   - Update procedures
   - Conduct post-incident review
