# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Data Validation and Error Handling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop comprehensive data validation and error handling throughout the application.
# Details:
1. Implement client-side form validation using a library like Yup or Zod
2. Create server-side validation for all API endpoints
3. Develop a centralized error handling system
4. Implement user-friendly error messages and notifications
5. Create error logging and monitoring system
6. Implement data sanitization to prevent XSS and injection attacks
7. Develop input masking for sensitive data fields

# Test Strategy:
1. Test form submissions with valid and invalid data
2. Verify server-side validation catches all potential issues
3. Ensure error messages are clear and helpful
4. Test error logging and monitoring functionality
5. Verify data sanitization prevents common attack vectors
6. Test input masking for correctness and usability

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design client-side validation strategy [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive plan for client-side validation including required fields, data formats, and validation timing
### Details:
Define validation rules for all form inputs, determine when validation should occur (on blur, on submit, real-time), select validation libraries if needed, and establish a consistent approach for displaying validation errors to users

## 2. Implement client-side validation framework [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Build reusable validation components and utilities that can be applied across the application
### Details:
Create validation helper functions, form validation hooks/services, and reusable error message components that maintain consistent styling and behavior throughout the application

## 3. Design server-side validation architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish a robust server-side validation system that validates all incoming data regardless of client-side validation
### Details:
Define validation middleware, create validation schemas for different data types, and establish a pattern for returning validation errors to the client in a consistent format

## 4. Implement server-side validation [done]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Code the server-side validation logic based on the designed architecture
### Details:
Implement validation middleware, create validation schemas for all API endpoints, and ensure proper error responses are returned when validation fails

## 5. Develop centralized error handling system [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a global error handling mechanism that catches and processes all types of errors consistently
### Details:
Implement error handling middleware for the backend, global error boundaries for the frontend, and establish error categorization (validation errors, server errors, network errors, etc.)

## 6. Implement user notification system for errors [done]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.5
### Description: Create a system to display appropriate error messages to users based on error type
### Details:
Develop toast notifications, inline error messages, and modal dialogs as appropriate for different error scenarios, ensuring messages are user-friendly and actionable

## 7. Set up error logging and monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: 14.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive error logging to track and analyze application errors
### Details:
Configure logging for both client and server errors, set up error aggregation and monitoring, and establish alerting thresholds for critical errors

## 8. Implement data sanitization [done]
### Dependencies: 14.3, 14.4
### Description: Create utilities to sanitize all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities
### Details:
Implement HTML sanitization, SQL injection prevention, and other security measures to ensure all user inputs are properly cleaned before processing

## 9. Develop input masking and formatting [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2
### Description: Implement input masks for specialized fields to guide user input and ensure correct formatting
### Details:
Create masks for phone numbers, dates, credit cards, and other formatted fields, ensuring they work properly across browsers and devices while maintaining accessibility
