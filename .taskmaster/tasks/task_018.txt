# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Advanced Security Measures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the security of the application by implementing advanced security features.
# Details:
1. Implement HTTPS and configure proper SSL/TLS settings
2. Set up Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
3. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
4. Add protection against CSRF attacks
5. Implement secure session management
6. Set up security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
7. Implement IP blocking for suspicious activity
8. Set up regular security audits and penetration testing

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify HTTPS is enforced across the application
2. Test CSP headers are working as expected
3. Verify rate limiting prevents abuse of API endpoints
4. Test CSRF protection mechanisms
5. Ensure session management is secure and follows best practices
6. Verify all security headers are properly set
7. Test IP blocking functionality
8. Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests
