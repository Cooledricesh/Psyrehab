- Certificate validity: Jun 6, 2025 - Sep 6, 2027 (2+ years)
- HTTPS endpoint responding correctly on port 3443
- Proper HTTPS redirect mechanism in place

### 2. ‚úÖ CONTENT SECURITY POLICY (CSP) VALIDATION
- Status: PASSED ‚úÖ
- Comprehensive CSP header present with strict policies:
  - default-src 'self'
  - script-src includes trusted CDNs
  - style-src includes Google Fonts
  - frame-src 'none', object-src 'none'
  - upgrade-insecure-requests enabled
- All security directives properly configured

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è RATE LIMITING EFFECTIVENESS
- Status: NEEDS ATTENTION ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Rate limiting configured but not triggering during tests
- Issue: Each request creates new session, bypassing rate limiting
- Recommendation: Review rate limiting logic for session-based tracking
- General rate limiter: 100 requests per 15 minutes
