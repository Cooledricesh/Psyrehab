# Task ID: 15
# Title: Optimize Performance and Implement Caching
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance application performance through optimization techniques and caching.
# Details:
1. Implement code splitting and lazy loading for React components
2. Set up a service worker for offline functionality and caching
3. Implement memoization for expensive computations
4. Optimize database queries and add necessary indexes
5. Implement client-side caching using Tanstack Query
6. Set up server-side caching for frequently accessed data
7. Optimize assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) for faster loading

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure and compare load times before and after optimization
2. Test offline functionality and caching behavior
3. Verify that memoization improves performance for complex operations
4. Benchmark database query performance
5. Test caching behavior for both client and server-side implementations
6. Verify optimized assets load faster and don't impact quality
