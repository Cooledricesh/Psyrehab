# Task ID: 2
# Title: Design and Implement Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the database schema for the application using Supabase (PostgreSQL).
# Details:
1. Design tables for: users, patients, assessments, assessment_options, ai_goal_recommendations, rehabilitation_goals, goal_categories, goal_history, weekly_check_ins, goal_evaluations, service_records
2. Implement foreign key relationships
3. Set up indexes for frequently queried columns
4. Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies
5. Create views for social_worker_dashboard, patient_current_progress, goal_metrics
6. Set up Supabase realtime subscriptions for relevant tables
7. Implement database functions and triggers as needed

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all tables are created with correct columns and relationships
2. Test RLS policies with different user roles
3. Benchmark query performance and optimize if necessary
4. Ensure realtime subscriptions are working correctly
5. Test database functions and triggers
