# Task ID: 19
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Testing Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a robust testing suite covering unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
# Details:
1. Set up Jest for unit and integration testing
2. Implement unit tests for utility functions and hooks
3. Create integration tests for complex components
4. Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing
5. Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
6. Set up API testing using a tool like Supertest
7. Implement snapshot testing for UI components
8. Set up continuous integration (CI) pipeline for automated testing
9. Implement code coverage reporting

# Test Strategy:
1. Aim for high code coverage (>80%) for unit and integration tests
2. Ensure all critical user flows are covered by E2E tests
3. Verify API endpoints are thoroughly tested
4. Regularly update snapshot tests as UI evolves
5. Set up CI to run all tests on each pull request
6. Monitor and maintain code coverage over time
